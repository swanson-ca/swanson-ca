d- 👋 Hi, I’m @swanson-ca an engineer that became a lawyer and then a stay at home parent.  Now, I'm trying to be an engineer again.
- 👀 I’m interested in surf, physics, tennis, EE, golf, java, skiiing, javascript, c++, react, react-native, mongo, oracle, Qt, jetbrains, vs, vs code, notepad++, linux, windows, mobile, Food Delivery.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react/react native and brushing up on old javascript skills to prepare for reentry to the world of the living.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun but have to remain focused on finding an income to meet my unfortunately non-zero expenses.  I don't need much though.  I enjoy life best with a simple lifestyle.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here I think.  I left a public email address open.  The problem is getting me to check my email though :(  Hmm.  Damn Pandemic.  I used to be so responsible (finger's crossed behind).
